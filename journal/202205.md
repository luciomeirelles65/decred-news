## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

[v1.7.2 patch](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.7.2) has been released fixing a rare and hard to hit case when optional indexing is enabled.

The general direction in May was to further leverage the consensus changes that activated recently, by adding optimizations and removing unneeded code.

- Implemented header [proof storage](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2938). This modifies the chain logic to create and store the individual commitment hashes covered by the commitment root field of the header of each block, adds code to migrate the database to retroactively create and store entries for all applicable historical blocks, and updates the code that generates inclusion proofs to use the stored data instead so that it will continue to work properly when new header commitments are added without further modification. This change comes with a one-way database upgrade.
  - { _To reword to an easier description: 1. Overall is it like a disk cache to avoid recalculating "derivable" data (and boost performance)? 2. Is it correct that currently "individual commitment hashes" only includes 1 hash (for cfilters)? 3. Can we say it is an optimization made possible by the block header commitments consensus change?_ }
- Header proof logic has been [consolidated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2937), resulting in the p2p and rpcserver handlers no longer needing to understand anything about the proofs. { _maybe remove as minor_ }
- Optimized [stake node pruning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2943) by using block headers instead of checkpoints (reducing dependency on the latter). Header-based sync operations are more efficient and pave the way to multi-peer block downloads.
- Reworked [old block rejection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2945) logic to replace the use of checkpoints with the `assumevalid` block (hard-coded in each release). Semantics have been clarified to reflect that "checkpoints" are now only used for handling old forks and are no longer used for optimizations (that now rely on other methods). The `--nocheckpoints` CLI option has been replaced with `--allowoldforks`.
  - { re /byebye checkpoints in #dev - is this a final defeat of checkpoints or is there more to do? }
- Added a function to make [basic transaction sanity](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2949) checks to the `blockchain/standalone` module, which is nice for consumers (e.g. DCRDEX) since this module has very few dependencies.
- Removed the deprecated [address index](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2930) along with the associated CLI flags (`--addrindex` and `--dropaddrindex`) and `searchrawtransactions` JSON-RPC.
  - { _Is there more info on why it was deprecated and removed, and what replaces it?_ }
- Made [`blockchain`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2952) package internal and not exported. This is part of a continuing overall effort to reduce the total number of exported packages and modules to reduce the maintenance burden, and eventually get to the point it will be possible to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the root module.
- Continued [code](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2922) [cleanup](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2954) enabled by the recent consensus changes.
- Retroactively fixed revocation [fee limit bug](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2948) that allowed one party to increase the fee paid to miners for another party in split transactions. This has never been exploited on `mainnet` and _can not_ be exploited since the automatic revocations agenda has activated.

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

Released with the v1.7.2 patch:

- [Removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2153) all ticket revoking functionality. Now that revocations are created [automatically](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) there is no need for wallets to handle it.
- [Added](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2146) VSP host to the returned ticket information, enabling wallet apps to know which VSP the ticket is managed by.
- [Added](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2148) `walletpubpassphrasechange` to JSON-RPC methods. It allows to change wallet's public passphrase.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2150) verification of signed messages.

Merged in `master`:

- [Fixed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2164) an error in the `getstakeinfo` command (caused by changes regarding expired tickets).
- [Compatibility](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2158) updates to the latest dcrd changes regarding missed and expired tickets.

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

Merged and released with May's v1.7.2 and v1.7.3 patches:

- Electron (The framework Decredtion is built on) has been [bumped to v17.4.2](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3765) to fix an issue that prevented dcrwallet/dcrd from launching on macOS 10.15 (Catalina).
- [Removed revoke](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3754) tickets functionality. Now that revocations are created [automatically](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) there is no need for wallets to handle it.
- Improvements made to [Ticket Status and Ticket History views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3751). Now the tabs remember their scroll positions after coming back from the transaction details page. Rows are loaded gradually using the infinite scroll functionality. 
- Users can now fetch the [VSP fee transaction hash and fee status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3752) in transaction details. If the received fee transaction is in confirmed status for an unspent ticket but the dcrwallet thinks it's not yet confirmed, the app processes and updates the status in the background.
- ~7 bug fixes

_vspd is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- 12 commits representing various code optimizations and refactoring.

<a id="dcrdex" />

**[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

_DCRDEX is a non-custodial exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

- Generic [wait and retry function](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1623) reworked to gradually "taper off" (slow down) after a few initial frequent attempts.
- Encoding now allows for transaction [data longer](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1620) than 65,535 bytes.
- Dependency updates to build with [Node 18](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1617).
- Updates to newer modules from [btcsuite and go-ethereum](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1542).
- Added methods for [calculating the median fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1597) of the most recent block(s) in BTC/DOGE/LTC/BCH. Implemented a cache to prevent repeated scans between blocks, and a fallback if there is not enough data to estimate the fee.
- Support updating server's [TLS certificate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1602) with one supplied by the user.
- A button has been added to the Wallets page to [recreate the BTC SPV wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1507), as there are still many ways how it could get [corrupted](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1438).
- Added support for [accelerating BTC transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1555) using the [Child Pays For Parent](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/) fee bumping technique. Orders page will show a button if the order is able to be accelerated. When clicking the button, a popup shows up which allows the user to choose a higher fee.
- Switched to Bitcoin Cash [testnet4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1606) now that it is first class in bchd. Also, added a custom encoder for BCH's [CashAddr](https://www.reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/encoding/cashaddr/) addresses.
- Implemented [stage 3](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1530) of the signature message truncation fix. It is tricky to fix a bug when it is "deployed" on many co-dependent servers and clients, but the devs have an elaborate [4-stage plan](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1526) for it.
- Simnet harness tests [generalized](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1603) to work with all currently supported assets.
- Allow [harness testing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1550) on testnet for the ETH client.
- Various bug fixes, dependency upgrades, and optimizations.

While working on DCRDEX the developers have made various contributions to upstream projects: [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/commits?author=chappjc), [btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet/commits?author=chappjc), [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24533), [neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/commits?author=chappjc), [zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/commits?author=buck54321), and others.

Dev team has started a discussion on [rebranding DCRDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/) and are accepting name and logo ideas.

> Probably found a vendor to perform an audit of our Solidity atomic swap contracts. Notably, our contracts are so simple, we're under their minimum order size. That's what happens when you're not trying to extract trading fees and there's no admin functionality. \[[@blockchainbuck](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1527105721724190722)\]

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In May the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 9,407 DCR worth $390K at month's average rate of $41.46. 2,950 DCR was spent from the legacy treasury to pay contractors, worth $122K at May's rate, or $179K at April's billing rate of $60.62. These payments were to cover both March and April's contractor invoices. 

As of June 12, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 795,673 DCR ($23.9 million USD at $30.09).

A new [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0ef42e5) was submitted by Raedah Group to fund GoDCR, the Golang Desktop wallet which will also be serving the purpose of a mobile wallet as development continues. This proposal requests $300K for 12 months of funding, a greater amount than the [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8) which was narrowly rejected in October 2021, with the extra budget being due to larger number of workers and a longer duration.

Voting was held for four proposals, three of which were approved and one failed to reach the quorum requirement.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4fdef29) to fund Decred Journal and Politeia Digest was approved with 99% Yes votes and turnout of 56%.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/7057e0b) to fund Decred content and asset translations was approved with 99% Yes votes and turnout of 56%.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/da2f32d) to fund continuation of the Bug Bounty program was approved with 99% Yes votes and turnout of 56%.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6bdffcb) to fund University events in Uganda was rejected with 47% Yes votes and turnout of 6%.

## Network

**Hashrate**: May's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=l2im68kw-l3x1522f&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~345 Ph/s and closed ~115 Ph/s, bottoming at 74 Ph/s and peaking at 381 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Jun 1: Poolin 55%, ViaBTC 21%, F2Pool 7%, AntPool 7%, Luxor 5%, BTC.com 4%, CoinMine 0.3%.

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before Jun 1: Poolin 55%, ViaBTC 20%, F2Pool 8%, DsV1GF7 6.5%, BTC.com 6%, Luxor 4%, CoinMin2 0.2%, DsmLNFC 0.1%.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=l2im68kw-l3x1522f&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 217-231 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 223.6 DCR (+9.4).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=l2im68kw-l3x1522f&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 8.78-9.07 million DCR, meaning that 62.6-63.9% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=l2im68kw-l3x1522f&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }

All missed and expired tickets [have been revoked](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2861#issuecomment-1144049589) - a total of 1,719 tickets worth 175,957 DCR (average price 103 DCR per ticket). ~45K of that DCR have moved already, while the remaining ~131K DCR are likely lost due to lost seeds and other reasons. One of the revoked tickets was from block 767, when tickets were [quite expensive](https://forum.decred.org/threads/are-you-still-purchasing-at-current-price-4-55-dcr.840/) already.

All new missed votes are revoked automatically, the first one going in block [657295](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/657295).

{ maybe a separate section to tell about this massive revocation? }

**VSP**: On Jun 1, ~6,900 (+120) live tickets were managed by 16 [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers, or 16.8% of the ticket pool (+0.2%).

Legacy (dcrstakepool) tickets can no longer be voted since May 8 when the chain forked to the new rules. Unlike all other shutdown/stalled legacy VSPs, the ones from coinmine.pl and decredbrasil.com have reported that they're on a current block height on Jun 1 and hold 19 live tickets in total. We are not sure how this is possible and are not counting these tickets in the reported stats.

**Nodes**: Throughout May there were around ~185 reachable nodes according to [PD Analytics](https://analytics.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of Jun 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (160 total, dcrd only): v1.7.1 - 41%, v1.7.2 - 20%, v1.7.0 - 12%, v1.7.0 dev builds - 9%, v1.8.0 dev builds - 4%, v1.6.x - 6%, v1.5.x - 4%.

## Ecosystem

{ _Hint: "Ecosystem" is about new units of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors, investors. It is more about user-facing services, businesses, and wider adoption, while Network is more about the backbone. Use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best._ }

Insider trading in the crypto space is increasingly in the spotlight. The Wall Street Journal featured an [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-might-have-an-insider-trading-problem-11653084398) about suspected insider trading around exchange listings on Binance, Coinbase and FTX. The analysis was conducted by Argus Inc based on public blockchain records.

The former OpenSea product manager Nathaniel Chastain, who lost their job over profiting from the listing of NFTs on the OpenSea front page in September, has now been [arrested](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/former-opensea-employee-charged-in-first-ever-nft-insider-trading-case.html) and charged with insider trading by prosecutors in New York's Southern District. Although the NFTs in question are not the usual securities which insider trading laws apply to, the DA is alleging that Chastain injured his employer (OpenSea) by misappropriating information.

Actor Seth Green [lost](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show) his bored ape in a phishing incident, made even more consequential by the fact that the ape had been set to star in a new show he was developing, *White Horse Tavern*. In June Green paid a $260,000 [ransom](https://www.businessinsider.com/seth-green-pays-260000-return-stolen-bored-ape-ethereum-nft-2022-6) to secure the return of the ape, so that the show could go on (without raising a lot of copyright questions over whether the stolen ape's image could be used).
