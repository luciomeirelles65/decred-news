## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master ._}

- Implemented header [proof storage](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2938) This modifies the chain logic to create and store the individual commitment hashes covered by the commitment root field of the header of each block, adds code to migrate the database to retroactively create and store entries for all applicable historical blocks, and updates the code that generates inclusion proofs to use the stored data instead so that it will continue to work properly when new header commitments are added without further modification.
- Header proof logic has been [consolidated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2937), resulting in the p2p and rpcserver handlers no longer needing to understand anything about the proofs.
- 1.7 release [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2935) to use the latest version of the 'blockchain' module and [bumped for 1.7.2](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2936).

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master ._}

- Electron (The framework Decredtion is built on) has been [bumped to v17.4.2.](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3765) This fixes an issue that caused dcrwallet/dcrd to not be able to be launch on macOS 10.15 (Catalina)
- Fixes made to info [modal columns](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3767) and justification. The privacy tab now displays "Stakeshuffle++" inside of "Coin Mixer".
- The Decred Stakeshuffle++ mixing server now uses [constants](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3768) instead of magics.
- Ticket History [QR Code](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3764) button fixed.
- Fixes to [1.7.2 UI issues](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3760) - A typo in the Staking infographic has been fixed, and Vote Transaction Agenda Choice colors will no longer move when user scrolls.
- Fixed the [loading more](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3756) tickets issue.
- Improved the loading state of the [Fetch VSP Ticket Status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3755)
- [Remove revoke](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3754) tickets functionality. Now that revocations are created [automatically](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) there is no need for any revoke ticket functionality.
- Improvements made to [Ticket Status and Ticket History views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3751). Now the tabs remember their scroll positions after coming back from the transaction details page. Rows are loaded gradually using the infinite scroll functionality. 
- Users can now choose to display the [VSP fee transaction hash and fee status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3752) in transaction details. If the received fee transaction is in confirmed status for an unspent ticket but the dcrwallet thinks it's not yet confirmed, the app processes and updates the status in the background.

## Network

{ _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._ }

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: May's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_set zoom to show the month_} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) {_monthly zoom_} varied between {n}-{n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }
