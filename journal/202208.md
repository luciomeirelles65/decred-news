### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master ._}

dcrd v1.7.4 was released to fix testnet mining algorithm as detailed below. It was a source code only release as it is primarily intended for developers { right? }.

Merged in `master` and backported to v1.7.4 release:

- Enforced [difficulty throttling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2978) on testnet. Normally ASICs are not expected on testnet and blocks are mined with "slow" CPU mining, since it's not reasonable to require high-powered hardware to run tesnet. There is no financial incentive either because tesnet coins have no value and ASIC miners have a better choice to mine mainnet coins for profit. Despite that, a bunch of ASICs joined Decred tesnet and ramped up the difficulty, which effectively stalled the network. To limit thea type of games that ASICs can play on testnet two new rules are introduced: a limit on maximum allowed difficulty and a limit on block production rate once maximum difficulty is reached. This should keep CPU mining feasible even in the presence of GPUs and ASICs. It should be noted that this solution is only suitable on a test network where no real monetary value is in play and thus the typical game theory mechanics do not apply. Finally, this change will invalidate the high-work chain which has stalled testnet.
  - { _Do we know how many Th/s or ASIC units were used to stall testnet? Any other details to entertain the reader with?_ }

- Modified handling of blocks with too few voting tickets to also [copy the regular transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2978/commits/659b7fed1f225861b8b689ead1a0466099992479) into an alternative block template in addition to the stake transactions. This makes template creation more robust in the case of duplicate spends and helps ensure that all transactions in an invalidated (under-voted) block are added to the alternative block templates.
  - { _It was part of #2978 but I felt it's fun to write about. If it's minor, we can just drop it. If keeping, how did it work without copying regular tx before? Did those tx make it into alternative blocks in some other way?_ }

Merged in `master` towards v1.8:

- Made longer running `blockchain` tests [run in parallel](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2988) to reduce the overall testing time roughly in half.
- Removed all code related to [previous script snapshots](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2989) now that address index has been removed and there are no other indexers that require access to previous scripts.
- Maintenance { 2980 2983 2981 } and small fixes { 2987, 2991 }.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master ._}

Merged in `master` and backported to v1.7.4 source-only release:

- Implemented method for importing arbitrary [public keys](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2177) and their derived addresses. It is only supported for watching-only wallets.
- Added checkpoints to [hard-fork testnet3](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2178) to new rules implemented in dcrd. Checkpointing is used to push the wallet onto the intended unvoted chain due to it having significantly less total work than the chain being reorged.

Merged in `master`:

- Formatted code with [Go 1.19](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2176) style. { _minor_ }
- Updated [difficulty checks](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2181) to the new throttling on testnet3.


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

{ _Hint: dcrctl is pulling most of the code from dcrd and dcrwallet. Often there is not much to report and this section can be removed._ }

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/commits/master ._}

- Updated to latest Go [modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/49) and [GitHub action](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/48) versions.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master ._}

- Added the ability to [refresh](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3785) the DEX window with F5 key.
- Treasury spending page now uses [testnet Pi keys](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3776) on testnet and it properly links to the testnet dcrd source code to verify them.
- Renamed "Stakeshuffle++" to "StakeShuffle" in [Privacy tab](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3779).
- 4 fixes { 3783 3775 3784 3792 } and various internal updates.


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

{ _Check Check these repos:_

- _. https://github.com/decred/politeia/commits/master ._
- _. https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/commits/master ._
- _. https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/commits/master ._

}

Backend:

- Optimized and improved validation in [`dbutil -migrate`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1667) command (used to migrate from one user database to another).
- Store [app version](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1671) as a single string to simplify the release process.
- Various [updates](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1672) for Go 1.19 (CI configuration, GitHub Actions, linter, and [code formatting](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1673)).
- Delete [expired user sessions](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1669) on startup. Tests for the session database have been [rewritten](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1674) to fix numerous issues.
- Updated [`dbutil -dump`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1676) command to work with all of the user database implementations.
- Freeze [Trillian trees](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1670) that correspond to Politeia records that no longer allow updates (such as Censored or Archived). Politeia's use of Trillian is quite different from its intended use case and it results in high CPU load. Freezing some trees should reduce it.
- Fixes { 1675 }

Current GUI:

- Keep [quorum label](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2836) for Approved and Rejected proposals.
- Fixed common [invalid signature](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2842) error for new keys that were used before getting registered on the server.
- Fixed 2 bugs with legacy [RFP proposals](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2845) and ~6 bugs with legacy proposal [comments](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2852).

GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure):

- Deduplicated common [Babel and Jest](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2838) configuration.
- Added various information to the `pi` plugin: proposal status, vote duration, quorum, billing status changes, and error messages.
- Added [end-to-end tests](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2803) based on Cypress.
- Implemented RFP [proposals and submissions](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2848).
- Reuse [view breakpoints](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2849) from pi-ui. Breakpoints control which layout is used to better match the user's screen size.
- Fixes { 2839 2853x3 2850 }
- Code refactoring and cleanup { 2834 2843 2854 }

pi-ui shared library:

- [Custom breakpoints](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/459) made reusable internally and by apps that consume `pi-ui`. Added [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for CSS processing.
- Fixes { 458x2 }
- Improvements { 458 }

{ image candidates: 2848 is fun }


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/commits/master ._}

LN Daemon:

- Add `EnforcePing` [RPC call](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/163). This allows callers to direct dcrlnd to ping the specified peer and wait for the response. If the response fails to be received, then the peer is disconnected.
- Added [stall detection and disconnection](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/162) for peers. This is needed to handle situations where the computer running dcrlnd is suspended and then resumes after enough time has passed for the remote peer to have disconnected.
- Reduce [peer idle timeout](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/commit/02793bc8d7e2fb1b0775f24b87bad4c892e62ba9) to 1 minute and 30 seconds, down from 5 minutes. A 5 minute idle timeout is excessive and prevents correct early detection of stalled peers.

[Liquidity Provider Daemon](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd):

- Configured [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/5) for automated builds.
- Documented how the software [takes control](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/4) of the outbound channels.
- Added [TLS encryption](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/6) support.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/master ._}

Preparations and fixes for the v0.5 release:

- Moved [wiki contents](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1714) to [docs/wiki](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tree/master/docs/wiki) in the main repo. Now all docs are in one place and can be updated and reviewed by more contributors via the pull request workflow.
- Fixed confusing "connectivity restored" [notification](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1719) on first connection. { _minor_ }
- Fixed canceled orders showing as [100% filled](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1744) { _minor_ }
- Fixed several client wallet [hanging issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1732).
- Fixed a [deadlock](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1756) in BTC SPV wallet. { _minor?_ }
- Fixed [switching wallet type](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1759) to SPV.
- Rewritten much of [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1747) for the v0.5 release.
- Fixed several [deadlock and lock contention](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1739) issues in the trade engine.
- Fixed having to [refresh Wallets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1757) manually after creating a wallet.
- Fixed incorrect [error return](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1764) when looking up BTC outputs. { _minor_ }
- Updated to use the new [testnet3 rules](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1773) and switched LTC block explorer from bitaps.com to sochain.com.
- Fixed [match status](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1772) display for revoked matches.
- Embed site resources using [`go:embed`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1710).
- Fixed [changing DEX server](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1817) when the server is down. { _minor?_ }
- Backend fixes { 1751 1780 }
- Client fixes { 1736x2 1776 1799 1821 1829 }
- Maintenance { 1753 1774 }

Changes towards the next v0.6 release:

- End user (trader) documentation [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1715) to [its own document](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/master/docs/wiki/Client-Installation-and-Configuration.md).
- Improved candlestick chart accuracy by using epoch's first and last [match price](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1781) for candle's start and end rate.
- Restyled the [Wallets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1700). The new style is responsive and adjusts to desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes.
- Server installation guide [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1793) to [its own document](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/master/docs/wiki/Server-Installation.md).
- Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1785) to latest btcsuite, go-ethereum, go-bip39 and minimum Go 1.18.
- Added a guide to get started with [writing fuzzing tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1766).
- Automated [Markdown linting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1796) to ensure consistent formatting.
- Fixed [concurrent logins](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1761). { _minor_ }
- Adjusted [order cancellation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1682) policy to penalize too fast cancellations. If the order sits for at least one full epoch it can still be cancelled for "free" (without hurting user's reputation score). This should improve trading experience [for humans](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1682#issuecomment-1165059876).
- Transaction wait time made [configurable](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1789) by server operator. It is the maximum time server will search for client-reported transactions before erroring.
- Updated Node.js [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1792) for the v0.6 dev cycle.
- Implemented [live wallet reconfiguration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1786) for DCR and ETH. It allows to correctly track locked coins across changes to wallet configuration.
- Fixed [API errors](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1806) showing up in bell notifications.
- Translated page templates are now generated [at runtime](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1826). It removes the need to re-generate them manually and simplifies updating translations or adding new languages.
- Support both released v1.7 and in-development v1.8 [versions of dcrd and dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1822). { _group in maintenance?_ }
- Client fixes { 1787 1791 1758 1800 1810 1798x2 1811 1823 }
- Maintenance { 1795 1801 }
- Fixes { 1802 1809 }

Ethereum support:

- Enabled [token trading](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1622) on the UI with new wallet creation flow for token wallets that includes a step to sync the parent chain (such as Ethereum).

{ _Cover v0.5.0, v0.5.1 and v0.5.2 released on Aug 29_

- https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.0
  - There is a TODO for Server - shall we call it "released" yet?
- https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.1
- https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.2
- Are binaries now produced by DCRDEX itself?

}

{ _Better group changes_ }

### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the decred.org website._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commits/master ._}

[Decred.org](https://decred.org/) has been completely overhauled as approved by stakeholders in the [D.R.E.A.M. 2: Dream Harder](https://proposals.decred.org/record/5ef57f7) proposal. New messaging is "Decred - Money Evovled".

Summary of [site changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1056):

- Complete overhaul of theme and style.
- Updated messaging using strong words and simple language.
- Support and Publications sections added to [Community page](https://decred.org/community/).
- Removed `/chat` subpage (it redirected to [chat.decred.org](https://chat.decred.org)).
- Removed `/brief`, `/sustainable`, `/adaptable`, `/security`, and `/history` subpages.
- Removed legacy stakepools from the [VSP list](https://decred.org/vsp/).

Technical details:

- Site is implemented as much as possible without JavaScript. JS is used for:
  - Top navigation bar on mobile
  - Populating VSP table
  - OS-specific download links on the home page
- Previous site was built on drag-and-drop editor Webflow. The Webflow CSS has been replaced with Bootstrap.
- All site CSS (including Bootstrap) is compiled from SCSS source.
- New site does not contain any videos or Lottie animations, so all css/js for those has been removed.
- `apps.yml`, `current_release.yml` and `links.yml` consolidated to remove duplcation. All wallet links and versions now reside in one file [`wallets.yml`](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/blob/master/src/data/wallets/wallets.yml).
- SourceSansPro font replaced with a mixture of Poppins and Inter. SourceCodePro remains the monospace font.

Other site changes:

- Updated [Matrix support](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1060) link. Now [decred.org/matrix-support](https://decred.org/matrix-support/) redirects to #support chat room in our self-hosted Element client.
- Removed 4 [defunct exchanges](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1059) and 4 unmaintained wallets. Updated links.

{ image of the new website is a must! }

### Other

- Updated to [Go 1.19](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.19) and dropped support for 1.17 in various repos.
- Android and iOS mobile wallets have been [removed](https://bounty.decred.org/2022/08/mobile-wallets-no-longer-in-scope/) from the Bug Bounty program's scope.

Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixing service, was added to the OFAC sanctions list by the [US Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916), for its role in facilitating the laundering of proceeds of hacks by North Korea. The sanctions cover a set of Ethereum addresses associated with the mixer, and in the immediate aftermath of the sanctions being unveiled some trolls were [sending](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/09/someone-is-trolling-celebs-by-sending-eth-from-tornado-cash/) small amounts of mixed ETH from Tornado to the wallets of celebrities to taint their funds. Circle quickly [blacklisted](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1556712790894706688) $75K of USDC belonging to Tornado users. GitHub [removed](https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/10/github_tornado_cookies/) the repositories for Tornado Cash and also the accounts of at least 3 developers who worked on it.

Two days later a developer who worked on Tornado Cash, Alexey Pertsev, was [arrested](https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/) in Amsterdam by the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service on suspicion of helping to facilitate money laundering. The Dutch authorities are holding Pertsev for 3 months until a trial can be arranged, but so far they have not been charged with a specific crime, and their wife has [denied links]() to Russian espionage.

A whole DeFi ecosystem on Solana (Saber protocol) was [revealed](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/04/master-of-anons-how-a-crypto-developer-faked-a-defi-ecosystem/) to be the work of two brothers, a lot of fake developer accounts, and some techniques for double or triple counting the assets locked into the protocol.

Maker DAO has been supporting the DAI stablecoin since launch in 2019 and its governance serves to determine how the MKR ecosystem develops. Most participants in Maker DAO governance seem to agree that it is not going well and needs to change, but there are disagreements about how it should change. In a recent [podcast debade](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_kfHdCLUk) MKR founder Rune Christensen made a case that people working for the DAO were getting too comfortable and trying to expand the organisation in ways which suited themselves. Hasu (pseudonymous crypto researcher, MKR governance delegate) represented the side of DAO contributors who could see that MKR holders were being presented with sub-optimal proposal decisions which they were not always well suited to answer - but several proposals to create new core groups which would provide a certain kind of intelligence to the token holders were recently rejected. One twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/g_dip/status/1564716178819653632) on the subject adds a 3rd faction, decentralization maximalists who want to see the smart contracts locked down or "ossified" so that they cannot be changed in response to changing regulation. Rune is however the main character whose return from semi-retirement heralded a change in direction away from what the DAO's contributors and in some cases VC backers were planning. Rune has provided an epic "End Game" plan but it is extremely long and complex, split into several long forum posts, so it's not clear how many people support that.

[Leaked videos](https://cryptoleaks.info/case-no-3) have been circulated of lawyer Kyle Roche bragging about their work with Ava Labs, which included tying other competing projects up with frivolous lawsuits. Ava labs have [denied](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/29/obvious-nonsense-prominent-blockchains-founder-dismisses-smear-campaign-allegation/) the sensational account of their arrangement with the firm which cryptoleaks published, and Kyle Roche has [withdrawn](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/31/crypto-lawyer-kyle-roche-withdraws-from-tether-bitfinex-tron-and-bitmex-lawsuits-after-cryptoleaks-scandal/) from a number of the aforementioned class action lawsuits.
