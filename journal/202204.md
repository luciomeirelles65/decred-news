## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

- Removed all RPCs and associated code related to [missed and expired tickets](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2911). With the [automatic revocations](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki) consensus change, wallets will not really need these RPCs anymore. In addition to lowering the maintenance costs, this removal unlocks performance optimizations of the ticket database.
- [Optimized old block](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2912) version upgrade checks.
- Added documentations for what is expected for [backported pull requests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2934).
- Various bug fixes, code optimizations, and other improvements, especially for the major [subsidy split consensus change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4).

More progress made towards the [`primitives`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2786) module:

- Implemented a [subsidy cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2920) with functions to calculate subsidies for proof-of-work, votes, and the treasury. Also includes a full suite of tests and benchmarks.

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

Decredition 1.7.2 will include many improvements. Users are urged to [upgrade](https://decred.org/wallets/) when it is released.

- DCRDEX [login will be skipped](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3749) once the DEX is initially launched. This should make loading up the DEX faster and improve general workflow.
- DCRDEX updated to [v0.4.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3748) with some new features and important bug fixes. More in the DEX section.
- Per-account encryption is now automatic for [restored wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3746).
- Performance improvements in the [transaction's history tab](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3745). Notably, rows are now loaded gradually using the infinite scroll's functionality, which will reduce bottlenecks and sluggishness. 
- The Staking tab now features [an infographic](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3740) for first time ticket buyers, reminding users the basics of Decred's time-locked ticket-based voting system.
- SPV mode is [no longer experimental](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3739) for the DCRDEX. Users can access the DEX tab while running Decredition in SPV mode.
- An [alert](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3736) is now in place in the Governance tab when using any un-upgraded VSP. 
- Enhanced Vote details page to show a [warning](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3732) if consensus vote choices cast by the VSP differ from ones set in the user's wallet. The page will also show the VSP that managed the ticket, and the transaction that has spent (voted with) it.
- Added [block voting](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3733) info to the Vote page (last block validity, voting version, vote bits).
- Vote choices have been added to [transaction details](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3730) when a ticket is called to vote.
- UI now more clearly [notifies users](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3726) about new Politeia and Consensus votes.
- A [Treasury Spending Tab](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3718) has been introduced. This is where users will vote on treasury spends.
- Added redesigned [Tutorial](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3669) views under the Settings tab. { looks like a big addition, maybe expand this bullet if tested how it feels }

- ~{ 3735 3734 } bug fixes.

**Why run a full node you might ask?**

*Full nodes are the backbone of Decred. By validating and broadcasting transactions without relying on third parties they help keep the network decentralized. Each full node added to the network adds to its security and robustness. There are also [Raspberry PI Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-5O_GBcbV0) available.*

## Markets

In April DCR was trading between USD $52.40-$86.2 / BTC 0.001295-0.002163. The average daily rate was $57.22.

DCR rallied by nearly 45% to over $86 in one day on April 18th, its highest level in four months. This pump was unfortunately short-lived and speculated to be the work of the [Mining Cartel(s) suppressing Decred](https://medium.com/@tacorevenge/the-suppressor-part-1-war-of-attrition-3081a61b202b).


## Relevant External

The latest big news which seems to be affecting the crypto markets is related to the collapse of LUNA and de-pegging of its associated stablecoin (UST) - and there are claims this was driven by an actor who short sold the tokens to profit from this eventuality. The latest development at time of writing (May 12) is that the Terra blockchain has been [halted](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/luna-issuer-terra-halts-blockchain-after-week-of-losses/) to prevent governance attacks because the value of LUNA had fallen too low and the whole blockchain became vulnerable, validators will coordinate to restart the chain. This is the most significant failure of a "stablecoin" to maintain its value so far, as LUNA had reached a valuation of $41B which put it in the top 10 crypto market caps, but quickly lost 97.5% of this value as UST de-pegged and it [emerged](https://thedefiant.io/do-kwon-terra-luna-spiral-humility/) that founder Do Kwon had been behind several other failed stablecoins pseudonymously. This disaster is still unfolding but it seems set to result in major losses for people who invested in the Terra ecosystem and trusted its stablecoin concept - it is also already drawing increased regulatory [attention](https://thedefiant.io/ust-meltdown-regulation-yellen/) on the stablecoin and DeFi space.

In April, the JUNO community voted to [confiscate](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/29/juno-blockchain-community-officially-votes-to-revoke-whales-tokens/) millions of dollars of tokens from the wallet of user who was accused of gaming the airdrop to receive 10% of all airdropped tokens. After an initial sentiment poll in March which favoured revoking the whale's tokens the holder came forward and claimed that the tokens belonged to his clients. However the vote to block access to all of the user's tokens was passed with 74% approval, he has said he is considering legal action if the tokens are not returned to the clients who own them.

The Ronin Bridge, associated with Axie Infinity play to earn game, was [hacked](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-aftermath-of-axie-infinity-s-650m-ronin-bridge-hack) for $600M in March, when an attacker gained access to the private keys of 4 validators run by Sky Mavis (game creators) and one by "Axie DAO", and this was enough for them to take control and steal the funds. It [seems](https://twitter.com/ericgoldenx/status/1508844665881116674) the attackers also tried to profit on their attack by shorting the RON and AXS tokens, but because nobody noticed the missing funds for a week the attacker's short position got liquidated before the news broke. In April the Lazarus Group in North Korea was [revealed](https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1514645221027594245?s=20&t=cel0oxwoT1jPSOJCKsq0xQ) by Chainalysis to be the beneficiary of the hack .

Yuga labs have been busy in 2022 - [acquiring](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/bored-apes-maker-yuga-labs-acquires-cryptopunks-nft-collection/) the rights to Cryptopunks NFTs and making these match BAYC terms of use and [launching](https://nftnow.com/news/bayc-official-apecoin-token-launch/) the APE token to serve as a currency for their ecosystem in March, then  [issuing](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/01/bayc-team-raises-285m-with-otherside-nfts-clogs-ethereum/) deeds to land in the BAYC metaverse (Otherside) in April. The Otherside deeds launch was successful in raising $285M for Yuga Labs, but it was widely [criticised](https://decrypt.co/99256/bored-ape-creators-slammed-nightmare-ethereum-nft-land-drop) for a poor launch mode and implementation which saw users spending $180M in ETH fees in a gas price auction on poorly optimised smart contracts.

Cryptocurrency has featured in a number of ways in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with Ukraine [already](https://fortune.com/2022/01/31/ukraine-crypto-superpower-russia-crisis-investors-bitcoin/) having quite a developed crypto policy and stance before the Russian invasion. In the early days of the war the Ukrainian government [called for](https://www.ft.com/content/f3778d00-4c9b-40bb-b91c-84b60dd09698) and received crypto donations, and one month in had received over $100M in donations this way. However, by April the Ukrainian government's tone towards crypto had [shifted](https://fortune.com/2022/04/22/ukraine-government-banning-crypto-purchases-with-national-currency/) and the prospect of capital outflows weakening the national currency led the government to ban the purchase of crypto with the local currency, and limit purchases with foreign currencies to $3,300/month.

The prospect that Russia might use crypto to evade financial sanctions received significant [coverage](https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/us-regulators-seek-prevent-use-crypto-circumvent-russia-sanctions) but it [seems](https://theconversation.com/are-russias-elite-really-using-cryptocurrency-to-evade-sanctions-179559) that there is little sign of Russians state use of crypto, although the number of smaller retail level transactions has grown substantially since early 2022.
