## Events

Attended:

[Exitus attended a cryptocurrency meetup](https://twitter.com/exitusdcr/status/1506118577035825157) at the Hashhouse in Medellin, Colombia on March 21. There he informed attendees about Decred and it's unique features.

[Insaf Nori](https://twitter.com/in_insaf/status/1506976446044114944) was invited to talk about [Blockchain Technology](https://decredcommunity.github.io/events/index/20220326.1) and Decred Technology at the half-day training organized for their members.

## Media

[Applesaucesome](https://twitter.com/applesaucesome1/status/1517024462222336000) has written a cloud-based Decred [full-node tutorial](https://medium.com/@applesaucesome.dcr/decred-full-node-on-digital-ocean-92b904922291) using Digital Ocean.

Why run a full node you might ask?
Full nodes are the backbone of Decred. By validating and broadcasting transactions without relying on third parties they help keep the network decentralized. Each full node added to the network adds to its security and robustness. There are also [Raspberry PI Tutorials](https://youtu.be/B-5O_GBcbV0) available.

Decred society has created a [website](https://www.decredsociety.com/) dedicated to Decred related ideas, news, and other aspects. Applesaucesome also posts technicals and other information.
