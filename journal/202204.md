## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

- DCRDEX [login will be skipped](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3749) once the DEX is initially launched. This should make loading up the DEX faster and improve general workflow.
- DCRDEX updated to [v0.4.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3748) with some new features and important bug fixes. More in the DEX section.
- Per-account encryption is now automatic for [restored wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3746).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

## Media

[Applesaucesome](https://twitter.com/applesaucesome1/status/1517024462222336000) has written a cloud-based Decred [full-node tutorial](https://medium.com/@applesaucesome.dcr/decred-full-node-on-digital-ocean-92b904922291) using Digital Ocean.

Why run a full node you might ask?
Full nodes are the backbone of Decred. By validating and broadcasting transactions without relying on third parties they help keep the network decentralized. Each full node added to the network adds to its security and robustness. There are also [Raspberry PI Tutorials](https://youtu.be/B-5O_GBcbV0) available.

Decred society has created a [website](https://www.decredsociety.com/) dedicated to Decred related ideas, news, and other aspects. Applesaucesome also posts technicals and other information.
