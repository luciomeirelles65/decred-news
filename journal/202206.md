{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements before Development, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

- [Optimized](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2957) cumulative work calculation using the new zero-allocation [256-bit integers](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2787) package. The result is ~100 MiB less heap usage on average, and ~5% faster initial blockchain sync time.
- Support [clean shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2958) on more Unix variants and on Windows (triggered by events like user logging off, closing terminal window, or system shutdown).
- [Inverted order](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2956) in which transactions are added to the mempool during a reorg to correct the calculation of transaction chain statistics under special circumstances. { _Did it happen in the wild? What was the impact?_ }
- [Removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2961) the spend journal pruning code that became unneeded with the removal of the address index.
- Explicitly [reject](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2963) standalone `treasurybase` transactions. { _Looks like a minor change to merge into "other", but to understand this I wonder what would be a simple description of "proper" (i.e. "not standalone") `treasurybase` transactions?_ }
- [Removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2964) the policy that allowed low-fee/free transactions to get relayed and mined. It served its purpose in the past at the cost of some downsides. Now it is unneeded and users can bump the priority of "stuck" transactions using additional transactions (aka Child Pays For Parent - CPFP). Related `--norelaypriority` and `--limitfreerelay` CLI flags were deprecated.
- ~5 smaller improvement PRs. { 2959 2960 2962 2965 2966; drop after review }

Asset support progress:

- Added results of the first ETH [smart contract audit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1643) performed by InterFi Network (mirrored in [their repo](https://github.com/interfinetwork/smart-contract-audits/blob/audit-updates/DecredDEX_AuditReport_InterFi.pdf)). The audit concluded that Solidity code has "low risk severity" and "Decred DEX's centralization risk correlated to the active owner is NULL".
- Updated to latest [Solidity compiler](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1679).
- Added support for [Zcash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1570) (decoding blocks and transactions, signing inputs, tests).

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In June the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 9,134 DCR worth $256K at June's average rate of $28.06. 2,426 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $68K at June's rate, or $100K at May's billing rate of $41.46.

With the activation of DCP-0007 it was once again possible to pay contractors from the new Treasury using the proper stakeholder-approved method. This [transaction](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/18cede674d4d47919e7fcdb48fef0f56162a1a2f9536d5f08ac70e093a14e4f5) hit the required voting threshold (with 4,822 Yes votes and 0 No votes) on June 27th, there were 23 outputs, suggesting roughly this number of contractors/intermediaries were paid in the month, amounts ranging from 2.87 DCR to 767 DCR.

As of July 3, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 799,639 DCR (17.9 million USD at $22.39).

{ _Report any other activity with the legacy or new treasury._ }

Three new proposals were submitted in June. 

The [Decred Brazil proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/7f1d013) requests a budget of $22,000 for social media content production and events in Brazil, it is being led by @victorguedes.

The [GoDCR proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0ef42e5) requests $250,000, edited down from $300,000 initially, to continue development of GoDCR for one year. GoDCR was funded [initially](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/e5c8051) by the Treasury but a [request](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8) for $200,000 funding was rejected in Oct 2021 by stakeholders with 49% Yes votes.

[Decred Magazine](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3bb2c7e) has requested $34,000 for a year of content production and aggregation on the new website [DecredMagazine.com](https://www.decredmagazine.com/), led by @phoenixgreen.

Voting was held for four proposals, three of which were approved and one failed to reach the quorum requirement.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4fdef29) to fund Decred Journal and Politeia Digest was approved with 99% Yes votes and turnout of 56%. A detailed report on the 2021 proposal's deliverables and finances was published [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/1d74b88/updates/20220521.md).

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/7057e0b) to fund Decred content and asset translations was approved with 99% Yes votes and turnout of 56%.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/da2f32d) to fund continuation of the Bug Bounty program was approved with 99% Yes votes and turnout of 56%.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6bdffcb) to fund university events in Uganda was rejected with 47% Yes votes and turnout of 6%.

{ _Check https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/commits/master for updates._ }

See Politeia Digest [issue {}]({}) and [issue {}]({}) for more details on the month's proposals.


## Network

{ _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._ }

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: June's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_set zoom to show the month_} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) {_monthly zoom_} varied between {n}-{n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }

**VSP**: On {date}, ~{n} (+{n}) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers. Collectively the {n} VSPs managed {n.n}% of the ticket pool (+{n.n}%).

**Nodes**: Throughout June there were around {n} reachable nodes according to [PD Analytics](https://analytics.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of {date} [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) ({n} total, dcrd only): { vX.Y.Z - n%, ... }

{ _Optional_ } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=jz3q237o-la8vk000&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&bin=day&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ _Optional_ } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

{ _Add any interesting analysis or events in the network._ }


## Ecosystem

{ _Hint: "Ecosystem" is about new units of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors, investors. It is more about user-facing services, businesses, and wider adoption, while Network is more about the backbone. Use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best._ }

The crypto markets saw a significant decline in June, and although this paralleled non-crypto market sell-offs more broadly the crypto space saw its own particular issues around the insolvency of centralised entities and fears of contagious bad debt which could wipe out influential players in the crypto markets. One of the major threads to this unwinding concerned Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a hedge fund which was heavily exposed to the collapse of LUNA and then began [struggling](https://www.wsj.com/articles/battered-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-considers-asset-sales-bailout-11655469932) to meet margin calls as the prices for crypto assets tanked - partially instigated by the selling of Terra Foundation's BTC reserve to try and support the collapsing price of TerraUSD. The opacity of dealings between these centralized entities was highlighted by the behavior of 3AC's founders, formerly very active social media users who reportedly ghosted everyone their fund owed money to for an extended period. Over the course of June it has been slowly [revealed](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/29/genesis-faces-hundreds-of-millions-in-losses-as-3ac-exposure-swamps-crypto-lenders-sources/) that many large industry players had placed money with 3AC (which in turn placed significant sums in Anchor protocol for 20% yield on TerraUSD) and now won't expect to see much of this back. It is striking that such significant events for the crypto markets were mostly known about for some time through the on chain investigations of interested parties sharing their findings on twitter - and that the on chain entities these parties were transacting with held up relatively well through market turbulence, behaving as expected and forecast by observers.

On chain investigations have also revealed things that market participants would have rather kept confidential, like the price at which their leveraged positions would be liquidated. It was seemingly forced selling of assets to meet margin calls on DeFi platforms which alerted the observers to 3AC's issues. For the Solana chain lending service Solend, one particular whale's liquidation price and the scale of their position (>95% of the pool's deposits) was concerning enough that a vote was held to [determine](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/19/solana-defi-platform-votes-to-control-whale-account-in-bid-to-avoid-liquidation-chaos/) whether Solend Labs should be granted "emergency powers" to take control over this whale's funds and liquidate their position OTC in a way which would not cause chaos for Solend users generally.

Some DAO on DAO [conflict](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/14/gaming-dao-merit-circle-ygg-terminate-relationship/) occurred in the "play to earn" space, with Merit Circle previously voting to "refund" the investment of Yield Guild Games (YGG) in their tokens - at a price much lower than the current market price. This raised many questions about whether a DAO's members could unilaterally vote to change the terms of a deal the DAO had entered into - complicated significantly by the [confidentiality](https://twitter.com/Crypt0_lawyer/status/1536826577945862144) of the contract between the firms/DAOs. It seems that some members of the "DAOs" have hashed out a [deal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/14/gaming-dao-merit-circle-ygg-terminate-relationship/) to bring this to a conclusion without a potentially complex and expensive legal intervention.

For some months now [concern](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/20/is-ethereum-staking-pool-lidos-growth-an-omen-of-centralization/) has been growing in the Ethereum community about the level of ETH 2.0 staking which Lido Finance is responsible for (30% in April) - and the level of control over this mechanism which holders of the LDO token can exercise. In June a new [governance](https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance/2382) proposal was introduced for LDO which would give stETH holders veto powers over some aspects of decision-making about the protocol. 

To use Lido one deposits ETH and receives stETH, which will be redeemable for ETH on the new chain some months after "the merge" occurs - so the staked ETH is illiquid, but one can sell the stETH. Loss of parity between ETH and stETH was a particular stressor for [Celsius](https://decrypt.co/102812/celsius-liquidity-crunch-lido-staked-ethereum-steth), which was reliant on parity between ETH/stETH for its products to work as intended. Celsius was one of the firms that has been implicated in the contagious bad debt situation, owing significant sums to depositors and [freezing withdrawals](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/20/celsius-asks-users-for-more-time-to-fix-issues-after-withdrawal-freeze.html) due to inability to meet demand. 

The European Union has moved closer to [finalizing](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/29/eu-finalizes-crypto-money-laundering-rules/) its regulatory treatment of many aspects of crypto transactions. Many aspects of the regulation have been known for some time, but last minute negotiation was needed to determine thresholds for when a transfer between a CASP's (Crypto Asset Service Providers) wallet and an "unhosted" wallet would need to verify the recipient's identity. For transfers between CASPs they must verify each others' control of addresses. When a customer requests withdrawal to an unhosted address they must state the identity, and when it is to their own wallet they must verify control of the address when the value of the transfer exceeds 1,000 Euros. Peer to peer transactions have no reporting requirements. Long [established](https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1540640287923380225) aspects of the regulation will see significant barriers to the issuance of stablecoins, including "algorithmic" stablecoins.

The founder of Maker DAO (MKR), Rune, [returned](https://thedefiant.io/makerdao-radical-makeover-plan/) to the governance forum this month, bringing with him some radical plans to shake up Maker's governance in the form of an ""[Endgame Plan](https://thedefiant.io/makerdao-radical-makeover-plan/)". Rune had been absent from the scene since the Foundation was dissolved, and he has returned just as the people who were filling the voids he left in Maker's governance in various ways were bringing their own proposals for how things should work to the Maker stakeholders. Three proposals which had been under discussion for some time met resistance in their formal votes as participation rates for MKR voting [set a new all time high](https://thedefiant.io/makerdao-governance-proposals/), with a maximum of 33% voting in the LOVE-001 proposal - a proposal which would have introduced an "oversight Core Unit", and was defeated with 60% No votes. The three big proposals to change how Maker DAO functions were all defeated, with significant late stage [redelegation](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-42-valkyrie-makerdao-and-our-side) of votes and the reappearance of another co-founder who had fallen out with the project long ago but retained a large voting stake and came back to vote No on everything, dropping an [expletive-filled tirade](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-few-thoughts-before-i-finish-voting/16078) against the community's decision to turn off the buy-back and burn mechanism.
