The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }
