## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}

### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/cspp/commits/master ._}

- [@jy-p says he's made a lot of progress](https://youtu.be/1RBBNnrPqc0?t=123) with @jrick on Peer-to-Peer mixing for Decred's Stakeshuffle privacy service. Currently Stakeshuffle relies on a central server at https://mix.decred.org/.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/master ._}

{ _Group by topic_ }

- Optimized [high resource use](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1684) when typing price.
- Fixed creating native BTC wallet with [too small fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1657).
- Added a short delay for [sending ZEC](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/6045) after a block is mined in load tests, to workaround an issue with Zcash [output selection](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/6045).
- Clarified the message about [disabling a DEX server](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1634). With the recent account discovery features, a server can be disabled and reenabled as needed without paying the registration fee again.
- Fixed native BTC SPV wallet getting wrecked after [sending too small](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1705) ("dust") amount, which should not be allowed.
- Enforced [code formatting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1699) check in CI builds for consistency. { _small, maybe merge_ }
- Increase ETH [gas fee cap](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1692) for redemptions when base fee is too high.
- Parse additional [options](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1694) on TradeForm. { _not sure what it does, maybe just merge into "other improvements"_ }
- Fixed search box [layout](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1704) on Markets page. { _small, merge_ }
- Added ability to [export ETH wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1648) to Metamask.
- Fixed block monitoring for DCR SPV wallets and improved [connectivity error messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1701).
- Fixed [Filled percentage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1711) display for market buys.
- Added general support for [live wallet reconfiguration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1686) and implemented it for BTC. This allows locked coins to be re-established after wallet configuration was changed. Prior to this change, reconfiguring a wallet with live orders was unlocking the funds but attempting to use them resulted in an error.
- Fixed users getting [order completion credit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1707) for revoked orders in rare circumstances.
- Support [external source](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1654) of transaction fee estimates for DCR wallets (dcrdata's Insight API), to serve as a fallback when the wallet cannot get the fee estimate locally.
- Display [fiat equivalents](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1600) on various pages.
- Added support for common [Electrum SPV](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1607) wallets (BTC, LTC, BCH). DEX client can communicate with a local Electrum wallet (min version 4.2) and use its funds for trading.
- Implemented [fee rate caching and expiry](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1721) to resolve a long-standing issue of using outdated fee rate. Also optimized how frequent fee rate is fetched from various sources (wallet, order book, external API).
- Changed how [ETH wallet's private key](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1702) is derived to have an extra step where Ethereum BIP-39 mnemonic is generated, and then the private key is derived from that seed. This leaves the door open to exporting both the seed words and the account private key in the future.
- Minimum required [Bitcoin Core version](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1735) bumped to v0.21 (and v22 for using descriptor wallets).
- Added a test for [arithmetic overflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1722) in the Ethereum's Solidity contract. Starting with Solidity v0.8.0 the transaction _should_ be reverted automatically if there is an overflow. The test is added just in case Solidity version used in DCRDEX is somehow reduced below v0.8.0, or if future Solidity versions remove this protection. However unlikely that may be, it's better be safe than sorry.

- Testing improvements { 1691 1743 1745 }
- Other improvements { 1709 1723 } and fixes { 1713 1729 1746 1740 }
